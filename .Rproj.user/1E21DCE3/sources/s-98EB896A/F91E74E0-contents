# Cooperative House Share in PG: Giant Master Bedroom Available

## Location/Facility

Sunny, 560-sqft master bedroom available unfurnished in a 4 Bd/3 Ba single-story home. 
Features en-suite bath, walk-in closet, and built-in bookshelves. Ideal for roommates or a couple; there are even two sinks!

Located one block from Asilomar SB, half a block from the coastal trail, easily bikeable from Monterey Bay Aquarium, Hopkins Marine Station and New Monterey. Also within range of MIIS, NPS and points downtown.

Rental includes full use of shared kitchen, furnished living room, washer/dryer, back porch and garage with shop, recreational and storage space.

Renters would share these common spaces with three other housemates, one of which serves as tenant-manager to ensure any maintenance issues are promptly addressed. 

## Intention

Though this room is larger than many apartments, we three hope our new housemates will be active members of our five-person house community. To make the most of our abundant shared space, we will all amend and agree on a community contract following move-in. Tidiness is a MUST, as respect for common space reflects respect for one another.

Prospective housemates can look forward to anything from simple coexistence to a co-op model complete with shared meals and collective buying power. The course taken depends on desires and needs of current residents.

Points of interest:

* Are you a student or lifelong learner?
Cohousing is a great opportunity to gain new skills and perspectives. This house
will likely host a handful of current students; if you are a curious person in
search of others, this could be the place for you!

* Into gardening?
The house is on a 1/5 acre lot with a broad range of sun exposure. Plans are in
the works to amend the soil and grow fruits and vegetables. Please come lend a
hand, your expertise, or both!

* Into DIY?
Unlike most rooms for rent, these come with a broad shared workbench, access
to basic tools, and hopefully good ideas.

* Surfing? Biking? Diving?
Gear-hanging space abounds in the garage so you can seek adventure at a moment's notice.

## The Nitty Gritty
