Drivers and software for making spectrophotometric measurements under pressure.

**Teach your old spec new tricks!**

These drivers and interfaces provide an cross-patform, open-source interface for
instruments that previously required proprietary Windows software.

## Hardware drivers

* Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer `planned`

* Custom Arduino-based [automated anisotropy attachment](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1db0db26212f14031e666f19/w/448c90cea9fc3d3bc0afbe71/e/e4e457f9585f35904780803d)

* Shimadzu UV1601 spectrophotometer `planned`

* Fisher Isotemp 6200 temperature controller `untested`

* ISCO 260D high-pressure syringe pump `planned`

## Data collection suites

* Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy `planned`

* Enzyme kinetics `planned`
